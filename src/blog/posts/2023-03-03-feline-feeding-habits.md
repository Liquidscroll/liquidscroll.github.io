Cats are notorious for independence, they are difficult to train and impossible to reason with. As such, it can be difficult to prevent a cat eat food it is not supposed to without completely removing the food from the cat.

In my case, I have 3 cats and one needs to eat special food which will make the others sick. To solve my problem, a device was created and data was collected to further ivestigate the feeding habits of my felines, specifically the effect of the environment on their habits.

My hypothesis for this project is that there will be a noticeable correlation between the temperature and humidity and the frequency of visits to the feeding station. The objectives for this project are 2-fold:

>* Enable the access of food to the appropriate cat without human intervention.
>* Collect data in relation to temperature and humidity to investigate the hypothesis.

My 3 cats have a large weight difference between them and so it made sense take advantage of this fact and to this end I created a 'feeding station' where food is to be contained beneath a lid which will open once the appropriate weight has been detected on the attached scale and will then close after an amount of time for feeding or the weight detected becomes incorrect.

In order to analyse data on the environmental conditions in regards to feeding habits, we must first collect the data. To do this a temperature and humidity sensor is placed alongside the device and the values are recorded along with the timestamp and record creation.

After some acclimisation to the feeding station, the research could be commenced and data collected.

In analysing the collected data, we can clearly see the temperature cycle as day turns to night and we can see an overall trend of humidity rising over the time recorded. Furthermore, when we compare the feeding times for each cat with the environmental conditions we can see a clear relationship between temperature and feline feeding habits, but not with humiditiy.

We can see that there is a correlation with feline feeding habits and with temperature, but not humidity, and this is consistent with what research has been done on this topic before.

From this research we can be confident that there is a connection between the feeding habits of cats and with the temperature of the environment that they are in, and we can see this in their tendency to feed at night when looking at a small time scale and in the amount they ear at certain times through the year.

Ultimately, further exploration is required in order to determine the true correlation between environmental conditions and the feeding habits of felines. There are various ways we can do this, such as by increasing sample size of this experiement and seeing if the trend holds for different cats or by increasing the time frame in order to see if this pattern holds for a longer period of time. Finally, we could record more environmental variables to see if there is a correlation with these conditions - such as the pressure of the atmosphere.
